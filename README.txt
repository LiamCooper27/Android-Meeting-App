Liam Cooper Android Meeting App Android Studio

This project contains amount of java classes of these are activities which have xml counterparts. The main purpose of this app is to provide users with the ability to create meetings which have data such as notes, attendees, location, time and date. In order to satisfy this I used a SQLite database to store most of the data, the data was separated into tables each with primary keys and some with foreign keys. I have a meeting table which stores the meetings data, an attendees table which stores what meeting a user is attending. Also, a colleague table, this is to ensure that when a users adds another user to their meeting they can then select the same user again for a different meeting. I have another two tables one is the users able which stores the users data and another called settings table which saves the users preferred font sizes and colours.
In order to add a meeting I created an activity which is mad up of a map fragment, which I set up using the api key, a list view for users to add to attend and text boxes for input from the user for notes. The main activity I have shows the users upcoming meetings, this gets the meetings from the database which are greater than the current date/time then displays them using a list view and list adapter. The list adapter is made up of meeting items, each are clickable which will result in being brought to another activity which shows the user the details about a specific meeting. Another activity used is the maps activity which displays all of the locations with markers for all of the users upcoming meetings. The profile activity displays the users details like email and name and it also displays the meeting history in a list view which are also clickable. From here the user can also change the font sizes and font colours. An advanced feature I added myself was the invitation activity, when a user adds another user to a meeting they will get an invitation, which they can then decide if they want to accept or decline, if they accept the meetings is added to their upcoming meetings. This feature required me to make another table called messages. Each table is accompanied with a repo class, these classes take care of the database controls like created, updating and deleting from a database. 

To run this project first load into android studio then run.
The first page you are brought to is the login page where you can either login if you have an account or select create an account which will bring you to the create account page where you can register.
Once your account is sorted you are brought the meetings activity, this is where you can view your upcoming meetings, view locations of your meetings, add a meeting or move to a different page with the bottom navigation.
The bottom navigation has 3 options, the home which is the first screen you are brought to which I have already stated. The messages which are the invitations to meetings, the user can decide whether they want to accept or decline here. Profile, this is where the user can change their font settings, view their meeting history or view their details.
Adding a meeting is done through the home activity, the plus button is pressed which then brings the user to the screen where they can add a meeting. Here they will select a date and time through selecting. Add someone to attend or pick from a list of people they already know. And then choose a location using the map fragment on screen which takes the location of the marker they have place.

The database is already seeded with users for testing:
